## About The Project

**React Redux Shopping App** is a feature-rich e-commerce application designed to demonstrate the power of **Redux Toolkit** in handling global state management. Users can explore various products, add them to their cart, and make updates seamlessly with a modern and intuitive UI built using **Material UI**.

### Features

- **React 19 & Vite 6.x**: Utilizes the latest versions for optimal performance and development experience.
- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**: Efficiently manages product and cart state.
- **Axios for API Calls**: Fetches product data dynamically.
- **Material UI Components**: Ensures a sleek and modern UI.
- **React Router**: Enables smooth navigation between pages.
- **SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)**: Provides fast and optimized JavaScript compilation.

## Built with

- **React 19**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **Axios**
- **Material UI**
- **React Router**
- **Vite 6.x**
- **SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)**
